If containers can use these ports, the container must be run as a privileged user. Kubernetes must stop containers that try to map to these ports directly. Allowing non-privileged ports to be mapped to the container-privileged port is the allowable method when a certain port is needed. An example is mapping port 8080 externally to port 80 in the container.\"\necho \"On the Master node, run the command:\"\necho \"kubectl get pods --all-namespaces\"\necho \"The list returned is all pods running within the Kubernetes cluster. For those pods running within the user namespaces (System namespaces are kube-system, kube-node-lease and kube-public), run the command:\"\necho \"kubectl get pod podname -o yaml | grep -i port\"\necho \"Review the ports that are returned for the pod. If any host-privileged ports are returned for any of the pods, this is a finding.\"\nexit 1",
